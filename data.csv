Even though you don’t have known food or drug allergies, these kinds of rashes can sometimes be triggered by stress, temperature changes, pressure on the skin, or even unknown internal factors. The fact that cetirizine and calamine lotion are helping is a good sign—it means the symptoms are responsive to antihistamines. However, since it’s been going on for over three months, it would be a good idea to consult a dermatologist or an allergist. They might suggest blood tests, allergy screening, or even a short course of stronger antihistamines or medications to prevent recurrence. Keeping a diary of when the rash appears and any potential triggers (diet, environment, stress, etc.) can also help narrow down the cause.

I can understand your situation and problem. Don't think of cancer straight away. Cancer is not that common.

Chronic chest and upper back pain can be due to musculoskeletal cause, heart related diseases, lung related diseases etc. So better to consult doctor and get done 1. ECG and 2d echo to rule out heart diseases. 2. Chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out lung related diseases.

Adnexal tumors or tumors arising from skin adnexa can form multiple lumps on the head. If possible, aspiration of the swellings will be required to know their nature.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",i had suffered from leprosy in my childhood. although the disease is not there. there is ulnar neuropathy and also sensation is not there on my right palm on the region of ring finger and little finger. i m 33 now is there any way i can rebuild it and also get back the wastages,"HiT hanks for posting your query. I appreciate your concern for the ulnar neuropathy secondary to leprosy. It is unfortunate that the nerve damage is almost irreversible, i.e. it can be repaired. However, surgery (nerve decompression) improves sensation in selected patients with sensory impairment and most often prevents further deterioration. Sensory loss, though generally irreversible, can often be ameliorated by simple longitudinal epineurotomy. Peripheral nerve reconstruction using denatured muscle auto-grafts may help to restore protective sensation in hands. Nerve grafts may be helpful for patients with localized nerve lesions like ulnar neuropathy. A multidisciplinary team comprising a neurologist, a neurologist, physical and occupational therapists, and a surgeon with experience in peripheral nerve surgery is needed. Hope this answers your query. Rate this answer if you are convinced. Wishing you a very good health.","Ulnar neuropathy due to past leprosy can lead to long-term nerve damage and muscle wasting. While full recovery may not always be possible, you may benefit from physical therapy to strengthen the muscles, improve function, and prevent further deterioration. In some cases, nerve decompression surgery or tendon transfer procedures may help restore partial movement or function. It’s best to consult a neurologist or orthopedic specialist for a personalized evaluation and treatment options."

Albumin+++ in the urine typically indicates a high level of protein loss, which may suggest a condition affecting the kidneys, such as nephrotic syndrome or another form of proteinuria. It's important that your nephew sees a pediatrician or a nephrologist for proper evaluation and diagnosis.

In terms of nutrition, to naturally support protein levels in the body, focus on foods like eggs, milk, yogurt, lentils, chickpeas, lean meats (like chicken and fish), tofu, and nuts. However, dietary changes should only be made after consulting a doctor, especially when kidney health is involved, since some protein-rich foods may not be recommended in certain conditions.

She may have some unknown antibodies in her blood that react with donors blood.  Furthermore, she should be given compatible blood.  Furthermore, she should go for antibodies panel test once to search the exact type. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.","I'm so sorry to hear about what you're going through — it’s heartbreaking, and your concern is completely valid. Thalassemia is a serious genetic blood disorder where the body makes an abnormal form of hemoglobin. This leads to excessive destruction of red blood cells, which causes anemia.

In severe cases like your daughter’s, frequent blood transfusions are needed to maintain healthy hemoglobin levels. However, if her body is rejecting the transfused blood, it could be due to something called alloimmunization — when the immune system reacts to differences in blood proteins from multiple transfusions over time. This can make finding a compatible blood match very difficult.

Doctors often run advanced tests to find the best possible match and may also recommend iron chelation therapy to prevent iron overload from frequent transfusions. Sometimes, a bone marrow transplant is considered as a long-term solution, especially for young patients.

Please keep pushing for answers — you deserve clarity and support. If possible, ask to speak with a hematologist (a doctor who specializes in blood disorders), and consider reaching out to international thalassemia support organizations who may help with second opinions or guidance."

It would have been better for us if you had told us about the tests your Doctor has recommended you to go in for. Is ANA in the list? Lupus and Scleroderma are autoimmune diseases seen commonly seen in women. ANA is positive in many of these females. Lupus and Scleroderma are diseases which affect many organs in the body. As you have just experienced skin changes so far, your Doctor might prefer to observe you for sometime before he goes in for some additional tests. Hope this helpsRegards","Thank you for sharing this — I know it must be really unsettling to experience those changes in your skin color, especially without feeling particularly cold. What you’re describing could potentially be acrocyanosis, a condition where reduced oxygen in the small blood vessels causes bluish discoloration, especially during cold exposure. It's usually harmless but can sometimes be linked to underlying autoimmune or vascular conditions.

Since your doctor is testing for lupus and scleroderma, she’s doing the right thing — these are both autoimmune diseases that can affect blood flow and cause symptoms like the ones you're describing. The persistent cold sensation in your thighs and the fact that your skin turns blue should definitely be evaluated further.

In the meantime:

Keep yourself warm and avoid sudden exposure to cold.

Monitor for any other symptoms like joint pain, skin tightening, fatigue, or color changes in your fingers and toes.

Document when the discoloration happens — take photos, note the time of day, temperature, and how long it lasts. This can help your doctor identify patterns.

If the discoloration worsens or you experience numbness, pain, or ulcers, follow up urgently. It’s great that you’re advocating for yourself "

Limit Carbohydrates: Avoid sugary foods, white bread, sweetened beverages, and processed snacks.

Small Frequent Meals: Eat smaller portions 5–6 times a day instead of large meals to avoid spikes in sugar.

Fiber Intake: Increase fiber through legumes, vegetables, and whole grains, which can help regulate glucose absorption.

Here are a few suggestions to consider:

Psychological Support: Consulting a mental health professional (like a psychologist or psychiatrist) is strongly recommended. Therapy—especially Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)—can be very effective in managing social anxiety and building confidence.

Mindfulness & Stress Management: Practicing meditation, yoga, or breathing exercises can help reduce anxiety and improve focus.

Nutrition & Sleep Hygiene: Ensure regular meals and adequate hydration. Maintain a consistent sleep routine, as irregular sleep or naps can lead to headaches or fatigue.

Physical Activity: Engaging in light physical activities like walking or stretching can help improve both mood and energy levels.

Support System: Talk to close friends or family members you trust about how you feel. You're not alone, and sharing often lightens the burden.

So please let me know the details as soon as possible. Best of luck, Chat Doctor.","Thank you for your message. The symptoms you’ve described—extremely poor memory, rapid hearing loss, poor comprehension, and difficulty answering questions directly—are concerning and warrant medical attention as soon as possible.

These signs may be related to a neurological condition, such as early-stage dementia, cognitive impairment, or possibly even vascular issues affecting the brain. Rapid progression of hearing loss could also point to an inner ear or nerve-related issue, and when combined with cognitive symptoms, might suggest a more systemic or degenerative condition.

Here’s what I suggest:

Neurological Evaluation: It’s important to see a neurologist for memory and comprehension concerns. They can perform cognitive assessments and, if needed, recommend imaging (like MRI or CT scans).

Hearing Test: An audiologist or ENT (Ear, Nose, Throat) specialist can help determine the cause and severity of hearing loss.

Blood Work: Underlying conditions such as vitamin deficiencies (e.g., B12), thyroid issues, or infections can also contribute to memory and hearing problems and should be ruled out.

Family Observation: Keep a record of specific changes and behaviors to share with the doctors—it helps with diagnosis.

The symptoms you're experiencing—neck pain, numbness, stiffness, and restricted movement after sleeping in an elevated position—are likely due to muscle strain or poor sleeping posture, which can cause temporary compression of nerves or muscle tightness.

Here’s what you can do:

Apply Heat or Cold: Use a warm compress or a heating pad for 15–20 minutes, a few times a day. If there is swelling, start with a cold pack in the first 24 hours.

Gentle Stretching: Once the acute pain eases, gentle neck stretches may help restore mobility. Avoid forceful movements.

Over-the-Counter Pain Relief: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (if not contraindicated) may help reduce pain and inflammation.

Correct Posture: Going forward, try using a single supportive pillow and sleep with your neck in a neutral position to avoid such issues.

Seek Medical Help If:

The numbness or pain persists beyond a few days.

You notice weakness in your arms or hands.

The pain worsens or interferes with daily activities.

Thanks L.","Hi.noted cholecystectomy several years ago and recent history of pancreatitis presenting as abdominal pain. The location of pain from an inflammation/infection in your pancreas is usually located in the upper portion of your abdomen, epigastric with radiation to left or right side or back area. This is usually accompanied by elevated pancreatic enzymes. It is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a gastroenterologist or do a follow-up with your surgeon, for physical examination and clinical evaluation. Diagnostics (such as ERCP?MRCP, ultrasound, liver function testing, bilirubin, etc.) and management (medical and/or surgical if indications are found) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor.","Thank you for your detailed message, and I'm really sorry you're going through this. Given your history of gallbladder removal and a recent episode of pancreatitis due to a bile duct stone, the persistent mid-to-right upper abdominal pain you're feeling near the xiphoid process could be due to several possible causes—even if lab results are currently normal.

Here are some considerations:

Residual inflammation or post-pancreatitis pain – It’s common for the pancreas and surrounding tissues to remain tender or irritated for weeks after an episode of acute pancreatitis.

Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction (SOD): This is a possible cause of recurring pain in patients with a history of gallbladder surgery, especially if bile duct pressures remain elevated.

Pancreatic insufficiency or delayed healing: Sometimes the pancreas doesn’t fully bounce back after a severe flare-up. Enzyme levels may normalize, but structural or functional recovery can lag behind.

Gastric or esophageal irritation: The pain near the xiphoid could also be due to gastritis, acid reflux, or even a small hiatal hernia, especially if you’ve had dietary or medication changes recently.

Since your GI appointment isn’t until November, here are a few steps you can take now:

Stick to your low-fat, small, frequent meals — you’re doing the right thing there.

Avoid alcohol and fried, spicy, or heavily processed foods.

Keep a pain and food diary — note when the pain worsens or improves.

If pain increases or becomes severe, don’t wait — go back to the ER. Persistent post-pancreatitis pain should not be ignored.

Ask your primary care provider if it’s possible to move up your GI appointment or see if a nurse practitioner or urgent GI consult is available sooner."

Your doctor is correct, and you can take the medicines as advised. I am concerned about your attitude towards your agoraphobia. Social anxiety is an anxiety and anxiety is bodies defense mechanism when it is threatened. Body's defense mechanisms are always safe and those may give you uneasiness and other related symptoms, but you need not fear the symptoms. Awareness is the first step of treatment. Please improve your knowledge about anxiety and panic attacks. Talk to a psychologist for psychotherapy. If you still need my assistance in this regard, please use this link. http","Thank you for reaching out, and it's completely normal to feel nervous when starting a new medication—especially when managing anxiety and agoraphobia.

Sertraline is a commonly prescribed SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) used to treat anxiety disorders, including agoraphobia. It's important to know that when you first begin taking it, some people may feel a temporary increase in anxiety or experience side effects like restlessness, nausea, or trouble sleeping during the first 1–2 weeks. These effects usually subside as your body adjusts to the medication.

Your doctor prescribing Clonazepam alongside Sertraline is a common and safe practice. Clonazepam can help ease the initial heightened anxiety until the Sertraline starts to take effect (which can take a few weeks). So yes, you can take Clonazepam if you feel anxious after starting Sertraline, just as your doctor advised.

Here are a few tips:

Take Sertraline in the morning with food to reduce nausea and improve tolerance.

Start at the lowest dose, as your doctor has likely done.

Stay in regular contact with your doctor—report any side effects or changes in mood.

Be kind to yourself. Starting treatment is a brave and positive step.

You’re not alone in this. Many people have successfully managed their anxiety with the right combination of medication and therapy. Hang in there—it gets better with time."

Here are a few suggestions to help manage your symptoms and reduce recurrence, especially when toilet access is limited:

Time your fluid intake strategically: Try drinking more water in the morning and early afternoon when it's easier for you to access a restroom, and then reduce intake slightly in the evening to avoid nighttime disturbances.

Focus on bladder-friendly fluids: While water is best, you can also include herbal teas or diluted juices like cranberry juice, which may help prevent bacterial buildup in the urinary tract.

Avoid bladder irritants: Reduce caffeine, alcohol, and highly acidic foods, which can irritate the urinary tract and worsen symptoms.

Empty your bladder completely: When you do go, try to fully empty your bladder to reduce the chance of bacterial growth.

Preventative care: If infections are frequent, talk to your doctor about:

A urine culture to identify any underlying bacteria,

Possible use of preventative antibiotics,

Or checking for underlying causes such as bladder emptying issues or kidney function problems."

But take it according to your doctors advise. So consult and get help. Early treatment will bring fast and better recovery. Get well soon. Happy to help you further. Thank you.","Thank you for reaching out, and I commend you for taking the first step toward seeking help—acknowledging your mental health concerns is a sign of strength.

Based on what you've described, it's possible that you may be experiencing symptoms of depression or emotional distress, and it's important to speak with a professional who can guide you appropriately.

Here’s how you can proceed:

You can directly consult a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist—there is no need to see a general physician first unless required for a referral by your insurance or clinic.

If you're unsure or want to rule out any physical health factors first, starting with a general physician is also a valid option. They can assess your overall health and then refer you to a specialist if needed.

Many hospitals and wellness centers in Bangalore offer walk-in mental health services. You might also consider reaching out to online counseling platforms that provide support in regional languages.

Don’t wait for symptoms to worsen—early intervention makes a big difference. Mental health support is just as important as physical health."

From last three days m feeling different like more leucorrea than usual, head ache,nausea feeling but not vommiting,weakness,frequent urination but the most unusual thing is green stool which I never had before.I saw it for the first time.moreover m having cramps on left side of abdomen,pain in belly n lower back.could I be pregnant.please help.tell me reason for this green stool(I dunt take any iron tablets nor I take much greens)
","Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  The suggestion any doctor gives here is, provide all the above information to the psychiatrist you are consulting. Work closely with him and he knows your problems. He should be able to provide solutions to your problems. Exercise or work plays a major part in sleep. If you work more and exercise rigorously, you shall get sleep. Otherwise, also you sleep. But the sleep may not be fulfilling or satisfactory because of the effect of the medications you are having and the lethargy you are experiencing. Do talk to your psychiatrist. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this website. Make sure that you include every minute details possible. I shall prescribe some psychotherapy techniques which should help you cure your condition further. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.","It's totally valid to feel confused with all these symptoms happening at once. Some of what you're describing—like nausea, weakness, frequent urination, and abdominal cramps—can overlap with early pregnancy symptoms, but they can also be related to hormonal changes, stress, or even something unrelated like a mild infection or digestion issues. Green stool, for example, can sometimes occur due to faster digestion (where bile doesn’t break down fully), changes in diet, or even mild gastrointestinal infections—it's not always linked to pregnancy. Since you're experiencing multiple signs, the best next step is to take a home pregnancy test if your period is late or irregular. That can give you a clearer direction. Regardless, it’s a good idea to check in with a healthcare provider to rule out infections or other causes for the abdominal pain and unusual bowel changes.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","i have stage 3 ovarian cancer I have had surgery chemo for a year the growth has slow down I was told I would not be cured. Therefore I stopped chemo. What well happen or what symptoms will I see next or how soon I am feeling more tried. Eating least, feeling full easily.","Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. As you stop chemotherapy, your tumor will grow at faster rate.  You may develop abdominal pain, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, ascites in short time. You should not stop the chemotherapy. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.","Thank you for sharing your experience—your strength is truly commendable. Stage 3 ovarian cancer is a serious condition, and it's understandable that you have many concerns after stopping chemotherapy.

Given that you've already undergone surgery and a year of chemotherapy, the disease may currently be in a slower-growing phase, but since a cure wasn’t possible, monitoring for progression is important.

Some common symptoms you might begin to notice as the cancer advances can include:

Increased fatigue, as you’ve mentioned.

Loss of appetite or early satiety (feeling full quickly), which may be due to fluid buildup (ascites) or tumor pressure on the stomach.

Abdominal bloating or swelling.

Unexplained weight loss or muscle wasting.

Changes in bowel habits or urination if the tumor affects surrounding organs.

Pain in the abdomen or pelvis, especially if tumors grow or press on nerves or organs.

These symptoms don't appear suddenly but may gradually increase. It's important to maintain regular follow-ups with your oncologist, even if you’ve stopped active treatment. They can help with palliative care, symptom management, and improving your quality of life.

You’re not alone—support groups, counselors, and palliative care teams can provide emotional and physical relief during this time."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I have had a swollen foot/ankle for quite some time. I have had an ultrasound down about 4 years ago, I have been to a foot doc. regular doc. and last fall, another doctor who finally said he thinks it may have been damage done from a blood clot that I had after having my daughter 9 years ago. When she was little, I woke up one morning to a very swollen foot that really hurt. This doctor told me to wear a medical sock when it bothered me, and that s about all I could do. Yesterday now was the 1st time in a long time where it really hurts bad when I walk on it, and it really swelled up. What should i do now. I tried icing it...seems to help for awhile, then I get up and it starts hurting again.","Hello, I read carefully your query and understand your concern. The symptoms can be related to a blood clot in the ankle. I suggest to wear graduated compression stockings. These specially fitted stockings are tight at the feet and become gradually looser up on the leg, creating gentle pressure that keeps blood from pooling and clotting. Elevate the affected leg and take walks to maintain the blood circulation active. I also suggest using anti-inflammatory medications such as Tylenol in case of pain. Hope my answer was helpful. If you have further queries feel free to contact me again. Kind regards!  Chat Doctor.","Thank you for providing such a detailed history—it's very helpful. Based on what you’ve shared, it’s possible that your symptoms are related to post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), a condition that can develop after a blood clot (deep vein thrombosis, or DVT). PTS can cause chronic swelling, discomfort, and pain, especially after long periods of standing or walking.

Here are some next steps you can consider:

Schedule a follow-up with a vascular specialist: If it’s been a few years since your last imaging, a repeat Doppler ultrasound can help assess for any ongoing venous insufficiency or new clots.

Wear compression stockings regularly: These can help reduce swelling and discomfort. It’s important to wear the correct grade (often 20–30 mmHg) and put them on first thing in the morning before swelling worsens.

Elevate your leg: Elevating your leg above the level of your heart multiple times a day can help drain fluid and reduce swelling.

Avoid standing or sitting for too long: Try to move around gently every hour and avoid keeping your foot hanging down for extended periods.

Pain and swelling worsening: If you experience increased pain, redness, or warmth, it’s important to rule out another acute clot or infection like cellulitis. In that case, don’t delay getting evaluated.

While icing helps temporarily, your symptoms may need a more structured management plan to prevent further complications."

Based on the symptoms mentioned in your query you are suffering from viral fever which is associated with myalgic. Your infection has started as infection of the upper respiratory tract which has spread to the lungs. Due to swallowing of infected sputum, some may develop an upper gastrointestinal infection also. I suggest you get a culture and sensitivity of sputum to rule out secondary bacterial infection which is very common in viral fever. Get a prescription for appropriate antibiotics based on the test results. The following tips are suggested","Based on your symptoms—a lingering cough, dizziness, upset stomach, blurred vision, a second period in the same month, and neck stiffness—it’s possible you’re experiencing the after-effects of a viral infection combined with hormonal imbalance and fatigue. These can temporarily disrupt your body’s rhythm and cause the issues you described. However, symptoms like neck stiffness and blurred vision should not be ignored, as they may indicate something more serious, like a neurological condition or severe infection. It’s best to stay hydrated, rest, and consult a doctor to rule out any underlying concerns and ensure you're on the right path to recovery.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I ve been on implanon for about 5 months now and have had continuos bleeding and now it has suddenly stopped, I have no bleeding but I now have a white discharge and cloudy urine . I was wondering why this would happen, if it s normal, and could I be pregnant? I don t have any other signs of pregnancy, I would just like to know is this is normal?","Hello ma'am. Yes this is seen as a side effect of implant insertion, but at times could be related to infections as well. Which is why you will have to visit your doctor at the earliest. Other symptoms like frequent urination, burning sensation while urinating, fever, chills, difficulty or irritation or pain during intercourse, blood in urine, etc.; are some of the most common symptoms to suspect an infection. Hope this helps. Best wishes.","It's common for some individuals using Implanon (a hormonal birth control implant) to experience irregular bleeding patterns, especially in the first several months. The sudden stop in bleeding and presence of white discharge and cloudy urine could be due to hormonal changes or possibly a mild infection such as a urinary tract infection (UTI) or yeast infection. While pregnancy is unlikely if you’ve been using Implanon correctly, it’s still a good idea to take a pregnancy test for reassurance. If the discharge continues, worsens, or is accompanied by other symptoms like burning, odor, or discomfort, consult a healthcare provider to rule out any infections or other concerns.

The area is slightly red and raised around the scratch with tiny little raised bumps. I cleaned it thoroughly and put neosporin on it. I had a tetanus 5-6 years ago. Is this a sign of infection? Should I  have another shot?","Thanks to Chat Doctor I can understand your concern on scratching there may be inflammation redness and swelling due to inflammation don't worry, anyway you cleaned it and antiseptic powder you applied just wait for 2 days, if not subsiding then start anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor. don't worry it may subside, take TT in. Further dose in safety please cut your nails and make them clean .ok try to avoid scratching .","It’s good that you cleaned the scratch and applied Neosporin. Mild redness and slight swelling can be a normal part of healing, but the presence of tiny raised bumps and persistent redness after 4 days could suggest a mild local infection or irritation. Since your last tetanus shot was 5–6 years ago, you're likely still protected—tetanus boosters are typically recommended every 10 years unless the wound is deep or particularly dirty, in which case a booster might be advised sooner. If the redness spreads, the area becomes more painful, or you develop fever or pus, it’s best to consult a healthcare provider to rule out infection and decide if another tetanus shot is needed.

Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I understand your concern and would explain that low blood pressure is not related to smoking (in fact smoking can lead to high blood pressure or increased peripheral vascular resistance). I recommend performing some tests to investigate for the possible causes,"Hey, thanks for your question. You're right to be concerned — a consistent blood pressure of 90/60 or 100/70, especially with symptoms like dizziness, blurry vision, and appetite loss, may indicate symptomatic hypotension. While smoking is more commonly associated with high blood pressure and heart disease, it can also affect your autonomic nervous system and blood vessel tone, which might contribute to blood pressure irregularities. Other potential causes include dehydration, nutritional deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, or even side effects from medications. Since you're experiencing symptoms that affect your daily life, it's a good idea to consult a doctor for a thorough evaluation and rule out underlying issues. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, avoid skipping meals, and limit alcohol or caffeine, which can worsen hypotension.

You are suffering from plastic anemia. Definitive treatment for plastic anemia is bone marrow transplantation. But till you find HLA matched donor you have to maintain your platelets and RBC count.  So only option for that is PCV and platelet transfusion. You should go for leukoreduce PCV and single donor platelets transfusion as and when required till you get donor. After that go for born marrow transplantation. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor.

Aplastic anemia is a serious and rare condition, and it's great that he’s already receiving care at Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore, which is one of the top centers in India for hematology and bone marrow transplant.

Since he's already at CMC, he's in good hands. However, for further guidance, here’s what can be done:

Consultation with Hematology & Bone Marrow Transplant Team at CMC: Request a direct consult with the hematology unit or Dr. Vikram Mathews, a renowned hematologist at CMC with extensive experience in aplastic anemia and transplants.

Alternate Hospital Recommendations (in case second opinions are needed):

Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai – Highly experienced in bone marrow transplants.

AIIMS, Delhi (Department of Hematology) – Another leading center for advanced care.

Apollo Hospitals, Chennai or Hyderabad – Their BMT units are well established.

Register with Bone Marrow Donor Registries:

Of course there are some surgical risks, but it is the best option for a diabetic patient. In case the surgery is successful, and he follows his doctors recommendations about the medications and the lifestyle, it will prolong his life. Wishing a good health to your father. In case of any further questions don't hesitate to contact me.","It's commendable that you've started spinning classes and are feeling energized, but reaching a heart rate of 215 bpm—well above the recommended maximum for your age—is concerning, especially given your history of allergic reactions and low blood pressure. While your average heart rate during exercise seems within a reasonable range, the occasional spikes could indicate either a device error or a potential arrhythmia that warrants further medical evaluation. Even if you’ve already undergone multiple heart tests, a stress test might provide crucial insights and is worth discussing with your doctor. In the meantime, monitor your symptoms, double-check readings with another device, and avoid medications like Claritin-D that have previously caused adverse reactions.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello, i am a 34 year old mother of two boys. i recently had a biopsy done becuause i have hpv. the results of the biopsy were that i have infected cells on my cervix. the specialist recommended that i get a leepcone procedure done but i would like to have more children and am afraid to run the risk of miscarrages from the procedure. i know im not giving you alot to work with here but how long do you think i can put of the procedure before running a high risk of the cells becoming cancerous? i was told i could also end up getting cryotherapy. i was told depending on which one the insurance would be that would be the one i end up getting. i am really scared.","HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor It is understandable to be scared. Though cervical cells can take a long time to transform from the initial changes to cancer, it would be best to have the procedure done when suggested by your doctor. There may be a slight increased risk of cervical incompetence (when the cervix opens during pregnancy) but this can be treated with a suture. The benefits of ensuring that there is no risk to cancer progression outweigh the risks. I hope this helps","It's completely understandable to feel scared—you're facing a tough decision while trying to think about both your health and your future family. HPV-related cervical cell changes can sometimes progress into cancer if not treated, but the timeline varies for each individual. Your doctor likely recommended the LEEP or cryotherapy to remove those abnormal cells early, before they become dangerous. While LEEP can slightly increase the risk of complications in future pregnancies, many women still go on to have healthy children. You might consider getting a second opinion from another gynecologic specialist, especially one with experience in fertility-preserving treatments. They can help you understand if monitoring the cells for a little longer is safe in your case, or if prompt treatment is truly necessary. You're doing the right thing by asking questions and advocating for your health—keep doing that.
