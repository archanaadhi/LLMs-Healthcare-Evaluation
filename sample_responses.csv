Will this go away on its own or should I see my GP?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor! Yes, from what you have described, it appears that you are having Sinusitis.

Since then I have a real tight neck that wants to keep dropping , neck pain , light headedness, back pain, occasional loss of balance and trouble walking and climbing steps. I recently lost my job because of these issues. My Neurologist thinks it is all coming from the neck tightness. My Neuro Surgeon disagrees and sent me to Physical Therapy and a Pain Management Doctor. They both agree with my Neurologist. The Pain Management Specialist told me that there is nothing that can be done. He told me 1 out of 10 or 1 out of every 12 with this surgery end up like me. In the past 3 months I started experiencing tremors in my right hand, right arm, shoulder, neck & head. Aggressive at times. I have tremors pretty much daily now. My Neurologist retired but wanted me to get a second opinion because I am progressing. I have not yet had a second opinion away from the same Medical Practice. I was about to when my Neuro Surgeon called and wanted me to get a Neck MRI. She referred me to another Neurosurgeon she works with to have more surgery. I saw the new Neurosurgeon. He explained he wants to take the hardware from my previous surgery out of the back of my neck and put it in the front to hold my head up. I was told it would not relieve the pain or any other symptoms I am having. I was also sent to another Neurologist in the same practice. She has no idea what is going on. Parkisons was ruled out. Both Neurosurgeons think there is something else going on and it s not coming from my neck. I can feel everything coming from my neck. I have had since May 2 neck MRI s & 4 Botox Injections, in the last 30 days an EEG, Brain MRI & CT Scan. All are normal except CT scan. It was to check healing for removing metal in my neck. I have an appointment to talk about that in a few weeks. Do you think there could actually be 2 different problems? My neck is really tight and like I said before I feel everything but my hand and arm tremors coming from my neck. I am really confused.",Thanks for writing to us.

In my opinion you should not worry much about her. As I don't think it is cancer. But better to get done some investigation s to rule out other causes. First get done ECG to rule out cardiac cause for left sided chest pain. If this is normal than get done chest x-ray to rule out pulmonary causes for chest pain. If this is also normal than no need to worry much. It is just musculoskeletal pain only. So avoid heavy weight lifting and strenuous exercise. Take good painkiller and muscle relaxant. You will be alright. No need to take stress and tension for cancer.

I have been icing it for 8 hours and i still get intense pain when i move some directions. At wha point do i stop ice and see a doc. I have a high pain threshold, but when it flares i can t use my arm","Hi, Thanks for your query. An initial X-ray of the injured part is mandatory to rule out any bony injury (fracture). If the X-ray is negative for a fracture, then the other possibility is soft tissue injury either to the ligaments, tendons etc. The initial management for your condition is as follows -- Give adequate rest to the injured part and avoid any movements that produce pain-Apply ice wrapped in a damp towel to the injured area for 15 to 20 minutes every two to three hours during the day-Compress or bandage the injured area to limit any swelling and movement that could damage it further. You can use a cr\u00eape bandage or a simple elastic bandage - Keep the injured area raised and supported on a pillow to help reduce swelling. - Gentle massage with a painkiller cream over the injured area might be helpful If your symptoms are still persisting after the above measures, consult an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation and management. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care"

This new Dr. said he wanted to lower my B.P. more, and they day I as in to see him it was a bit high 146/78 but no really that much out of line. He said he would like to see it 140/70 or less. The next day it was 131/68, and hadn t taken the prescription he recommended. However did take it a couple of days later, and my feet and ankles swelled and are still swelled, the Med was Amalodapine the dose I was on was .5 and he doubled it. I called him today, and he put me back on my regular dose, but added a new B.P. med called Spironolactone .25 mg. I have been on Lorsartin and Amalodapine for several years and it has been holding my B/P under control pretty well. Why would he want to be changing it...my thinking is if it s not broken, don t fix it, and my regular health care physician had put me on it. This is a new, young Dr. and it was my understanding that they no longer want your B/P to get to low, to you don t function well?? What is your opinion on this new med. He told me not to take my over the counter Potassium. Thanks, Betty","Hello, Amlodipine may cause pedal edema in some individuals. So he reduced the dose. Spironolactone is a potassium sparing diuretic. It is used to reduce edema of legs. If renal function is not good means better to avoid losartan. Because it will increase serum creatinine levels.

As there was stinky white stuff from a hole in the gum in the very back region of mouth, then it is most probably due to the hole from which wisdom tooth is about to erupt.

Your asthma actually triggers bronchospasm which leads to your wheezing and breathing difficulty. You can go for pulmonary function tests if not done. Treatment is mainly symptomatic which might require inhalation steroids, beta agonists, anticholinergics as MDI or rota haler as a regular treatment. There are very good medicines like steroids, alpha a Chat Doctor. To decrease the inflammation of bronchi and bronchioles, you might be given oral antihistamines with mast cell stabilizers(montelukast) and steroids (prednisolone) with nebulization and frequently steam inhalation.

Minoxidil is slow method, it takes time to show results, and you have to be compliant with its use, leaving it abruptly can again result in hair loss. So be patient and keep using it. Still if you don't find any results you can go for procedure like PRP (plasma rich platelet) therapy, it could help you as results seen are very good. And you can consider hair transplant too.

87069,"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",At present I am taking the drug Afinitor...in the past few days I have developed severe pain in my lower jaw where a root canal was done about 7 years ago.  I went to the dentist and they said the tooth is OK and gave me some antibiotic pills to get rid of the infection...I have only been taking them for about 1.5 days but still have the pain so I have been taking extra strength tylenol (2 every 4 hrs)...sometimes this works and sometimes it doesnt...I am also using a cold compress on the area but am still not getting much relief.  I am now considering taking some Tylenol 3 (with codeine)!  Do you think this poses any problems in interaction with the Afinitor.,"Hello, Thanks for posting your query. The pain at the site of root canal treated tooth, may be due to re-infection. I would suggest you to visit a dentist and get reject or extraction of tooth done, depending on the severity of tooth infection. Take complete course of antibiotics-analgesics prescribed. Brush and floss your teeth daily. Rinse your mouth after every meal. Visit a dentist in every 6 months. Take care."

My name is AAAAA I have been diayliseing for nearly 7 years, My e-mail address is  YYYY@YYYY",Hi I am Chat Doctor. As you are on dialysis for the last 7 years your blood chemistry is not normal. Various harmful mobiles that are secreted by the body are regularly washed by kidneys and in your case the dialysis. Bruising can be due to multiple causes most likely due to blood thinners. I will advise you take a coagulation test like pt PTT and liver function tests. That will really tell the reason for your bruising. Hopefully that will turn out to be normal and you don't have to worry about that if it doesn't happen frequently. Thanks
